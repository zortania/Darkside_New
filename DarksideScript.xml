						<script>--v5.0 - Split off of a Separate Shadow version called Darkside (Agothaxl's Attempt to Separate)

--CHANGELOG OF CHANGES

--5.06
--Cleaned up monk and zealot stuff
--Included new vivisect alias for Indorani
--Fixed some defs
--Fixed some curative stuff
--Updates to vampire things
--Lots of other just QOL changes I didn't document for myeslf so no clue

--5.05
--New toggle for questing. Queston to turn it on. This is to gate all that auto-questing and stop it from spamming.
--With this toggle comes questing for Aerie, Attica, Arbothia, and a few other places.
--Note that I will never make a full auto-quester/walker. But, having a system that'll allow you to still walk around manually and do the quests? Sure.
--Additional blackout tracking implemeneted.
--Additional curing added, primarily for clotting/standing/waking/endgame/backup sipping/tree from prompt.
--Prompt trigger actually changed to a prompt.
--First 1v1 script coded in for Archivist and tested.
--More tracking aff fixes/additions made.
--Updated Sciomancer code to not consider firefly stuff.
--Put in proper shaderot curing tracking for if darkness in room or not. Need to test.
--Lots of timers put in, just a fyi. Mostly related to advanced curing as I build it out. Yes, they have stupid names. Blame Mazz.
--Fix to mending tracking to hopefully help with shifter tracking.

--5.04b
--Minimal blackout stuff put in for testing. Mostly to build upon.
--Skiva's aliases for shapeshifter in and probably borking but mostly working.
--Golem calling on defup for Teradrim.
--Sciomancer channel shadow on defup.
--Updated Teradrim bashing from Ehtias.
--Some other shit, idk, I lost track this time.

--5.04
--Bunch of teradrim/praenomen fixes were put in and offered up in a 'a' version of 5.03.
--Fixed the 'pth' bugging in pathing (thanks Rebra)
--Took out 'eval' if you're calling and left it just for bashing.
--Added scour to 'pon' toggle for active curing. Teradrim/Carnifex/Praenomen have this setup so far.
--Teradrim routes fixed/tweaked thanks to Ehtias.
--Updated several things in appending chat, including deathsight.
--Auto-web-inviter if you have web calling on. This will invite if unstable and calling and they ask on web on raiders, or just in general if you have calling on and they send you a tell or login.
--Prepping some lines for Archivist absorb. Added new toggle for later (alias is 'sup' for support modes).
--Starting priority curing for several lifer classes. Based off Mazzsys. Needs testing.
--Fixed some shapeshifter defenses.
--Started putting monk triggers in from fallout so we can build monk defenses, but not converted, so folder is disabled. Do not enable folder or be prepared for your system to scream at you.
--New alias for sciomancers - kll. It's 1v1, but needs work.
--New alias for archivists - kll. Needs testing and work, probably best to not touch.
--Still need to work on a lot of things with curing, but panacea tracking may be improved for shaderot at least. 
--Lots of fixes in scio tracking in general.
--Some Teradrim fixes, too. Defenses. Tracking. Etc.
--LDD added for shapeshifter, but also separate ones for 'wolf' and 'bear'. Can build these out as needed.

--5.03
--Updated for when you die to clear out enemy affs/etc. Will test.
--Added alias 'whos' to check for who grouped peoples.
--Alias and all related items converted from 'pt' to 'pth'
--Alias for 'landmarks' is now 'landmarkst'
--Updated Syssin code for multi-aff checking
--Added lipreading to Syssin defense
--Put some stuff in to recognize to not channel any more. See if it helps with things.
--Testing Integration of Swarm Caller (with hybrid switch to snd.spirit if needed). Check out 'Auto Targeting' aliases. Let me know how it works.
--Vermin for Bloodloch, Spinesreach, and Duiran added. Vnums pending for Enorian. Bases which city it chooses from by your personal city.

--5.02
--Added in correction on class abilities for future curing updates.
--Scenting now, instead of reporting to WT, shows you the vnums and room numbers of people. Can click to path to them.
--Coded in counterattack stuff for Tcanna/Drakuum. It wield shield.
--Coded in a channeling feature (thanks Mjoll) to use for a 'pause'.
--Said 'pause' setup for waiting for dwarves to pop back up and go back to attacking them. Hopefully. Go into Maus/Tcanna to test.
--Auto-cham added. Type in 'tcham' to toggle it on. Thanks Zuleika!
--Put in a bunch of color echoes for auto-kill attacks, like reave and noose.
--Put in echo of when you're tumbling, and also should try to auto-cloak when you finish.
--Added echo for Ascendril enrapture, since it's something you could easily cancel someone doing.
--Alias "tr" will turn on rockharvest like before, but you can also then go to Mor and do "rockgo" and do a basic path around to rockharvest. Needs work.
--Bashing split up into Bloodwood, Vortex, Lair, Endgame, High, Medium, Low for your gogo paths.
--Several new paths added for lower level areas.
--Added in auto grab for lure, hammer throw, neckdrag for pvp aliases.
--Fixed Syssin bashing to change newbie toggle from bite to garrote.

--5.01
--Fixed the 'dison' alias to that. Whups.
--Added Khauskin to basher low.
--Updated autofisher alias to unwield all and wield pole, then cast line, for Archivist. Will build gradually for others.
--Archivist has had some route changes.
--Added in 'tumble' stops into Archivist, Teradrim, and Praenomen. These are done in the pvp aliases as they run, rather than off the tumble trigger.
--Updated some Sciomancer stuff to check for skills and whatnot. Just mostly in PvP.
--Loaded a bunch of NPCs into different zone lists.
--Added in reminder that you might want to GTFO with Calamity ticking.
--Added reset/clear of affs of you and enemy on your death. This checks by 'you are dead' message and also by having 0 health via gmcp so it should avoid illusion stuff.
--Maybe, just maybe, put in a fix that if it goes to try to parry and you don't have the skill - it turns parrying off. We'll see how bad this breaks people.
--Put in temporary fix to elevate torso curing if you are getting the message for hypothermia caloric fail.
--Updated keypad 0 for expanding 'aa' alias.

--5.0
--Reverted setup of Sciomancer triggers. Not sure why they were changed as extremely as they were, so didn't want to risk it.
--Fixed several Archivist issues.
--Fixed Carnifex purge and Praenomen purify to properly work and have alias toggle to use.
--Somehow this version was missing Sciomancer bashing. Fixed, and double-checked all bashing to confirm accurate.
--Renamed all Vampire items to Praenomen.
--Experimental vermin basher for Spinesreach added. Alias is 'vermon'. Auto-paths through part of Spinesreach and then goes to sell.
--Added aliases for 'firstaidstart' to setup basic firstaid priorities and 'OOC' to send ooc tells to someone.
--Put disperse toggle back in. 'dison' to turn it on or off, will work off faction member list.
--Replaced keypad keys with my usual, since they give you up/down/etc and make more sense.
--Added in a bunch of movement related triggers and set them up for you to call out info if you have target calling on.
--With the above item, also made it so vamps attempt to auto-feed on someone tumbling and everyone else tries to brazier.
--Fixed trigger where people ask 'where are you x' to check and call out where you are. Needs testing.
--Put in triggers to say who enters the fracture, for those who can sense it.
--Added in 'version' alias to check what version you're on.
