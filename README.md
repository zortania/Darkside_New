# Darkside_New
This is an alternative version of Sunder, which some heavier focus on things Shadow-side players desired having. Sunder itself is open source and designed for Aetolia, though it could likely be implemented for any IRE MUD.

Differences:
-Fleshed out class priority switching, though needs some tweaks/work. It is a good foundation, though.
-Some advanced in-system curing assistance, since sometimes firstaid isn't quite enough.
-Different fishing system.
-Different vermin system.

This GitHub was started to make it easier for people to contribute updates that they feel will help the system, be that in optimization or otherwise.

If you have any questions, you can reach out to Rihrin.

Installation: requires you to download most files. The primary files are Darkside Aliases, Timers, Triggers, and Script. Plus, you'll probably want the SunderNDB and NavButtons to make life easier. The other files are optional. The XML files should be installed one at a time, allows you to keep them separated. The .map file is for the map, which is used for bashing pathing. SunderNDB and sunderBasherPaths need to be put into your Mudlet profile and are part of the new pieces of Sunder.

Once installed, read SUNDER HELP for a lot of the information on how things work.

We're in need of contributors! Please feel free to fork and make PRs!
