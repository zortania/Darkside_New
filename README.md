# Darkside_New
NOTE: I started to sync my stuff (Linyive) back to Github for myself to use. If you download and use this system, it is at your own risk. I'm not giving you any help and it definitely likely needs work, but you could pick at it if you want to see what you like and want to use or not. I don't really care.

Files included:
-A map with wormholes, missing a ton of shit.
-Aliases - has combat and misc aliases.
-Scripts - guess what, these are scripts.
-Timers - yeah, timers, woo.
-Triggers - I get triggered all the time.
-Kai Gui files - UI files.
-NavButtons - keypad movement.

These are the main files to download. You can import each of them into your Mudlet in a new profile to have the system. Anything else in there is optional misc data files for various things related to Sunder, my old fisher, and Hunt Tracking.

There is *no* warranty on this software.
