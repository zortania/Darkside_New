NOTE: As of October 19, 2024 - I started to sync my stuff (Sysaa) back to Github for myself. If you download and use this system, it is at your own risk. I'm not giving you any help and it definitely likely needs work, but you could pick at it if you want to see what you like and want to use or not. I don't really care.

There is *no* warranty on this software.
