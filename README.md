# Darkside_New
This is the shadow-side version of Sunder. Sunder itself is open source and designed for Aetolia, though it could likely be implemented for any IRE MUD.

This GitHub was started to make it easier for people to contribute updates that they feel will help the system, be that in optimization or otherwise.

If you have any questions, you can reach out to Ceto/Rihrin.

Installation: requires you to download all files. The XML files should be installed one at a time, allows you to keep them separated. The .map file is for the map, which is used for bashing pathing. SunderNDB and sunderBasherPaths need to be put into your Mudlet profile and are part of the new pieces of Sunder.

Once installed, read SUNDER HELP for a lot of the information on how things work.

We're in need of contributors! Please feel free to fork and make PRs! If you want to contribute but aren't sure how, get ahold of Delra in the Discord. They're always happy to help you help this project move forward. 

There is *no* warranty on this software.
